			Exercise 3

			From problem 2, EJS Ch 3. page 56

			Write the "stack frame" at each call of the following
			recursive function. For example, if I call isEven(7),
			the first two frames will be
			num = 7
			num = 5

			Then, write out the return values at each level of the
			stack as it unrolls.
