			Exercise 4

			There are many errors in the functions below! Each of the
			"bad" functions (square, squareRoot, sum, and difference) need
			to be changed so that they are pure functions (only local vars,
			return a value at the end).

			There are also some errors in the testing section that you will need
			to fix.
