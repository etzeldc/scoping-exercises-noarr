		Exercise 5

		Bean counting

		(From EJS, Ch. 3 Exercises, Pg 56.)

		You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(N), 
		similar to how you get its length with "s".length. The returned value will be a string containing only
		one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position zero, 
		which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. 
		In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

		Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number 
		that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.

		Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a 
		second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). 
		Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
		 */


		function countBs(string) { //declaring a function called countBs and giving it an argument of string
			var sum = 0; //declaring a local var of sum to count ocurrences, set to zero because nothing has ocurred yet
			for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) { //start a counter by declaring a var to count through string's length
				if (string.charAt(i) === "B") { //if the current value in the counter is directly equal to "B", perform loop
					sum = sum + 1; //add one to the count of that ocurrence
				} //end if loop
			} //end for loop
			return sum; //returns the final value of the count of that ocurrence
		} //ends function

		function countChar(string, character) { //declaring a function called countChar and giving it 2 arguments, string and character
			var count = 0; //declaring a local variable of count to count ocurrences, set to zero because nothing has happened yet
			for (var j = 0; j < string.length; j++) { //start a counter by declaring a var to count through the string's length
				if (string.charAt(j) === character) { //if the current value in the counter matches the value entered into the character argument, perform loop
					count = count + 1; //add one to the count of that ocurrence
				} //end if loop
			} //end for loop
			return count; //returns the final value of the count of that ocurrence
		} //ends function

		function countBs2(string) { //declaring a function called countBs2 and giving it an argument of string
			return countChar(string, "B"); //returns the value of that string and the preset "B" character after it passes through the countChar function
		} //ends function

		

		// Tests
		console.log(countBs("Blah Blah Blah") === 3);
		console.log(countBs("abcde") === 0);
		console.log(countBs("ABCDE") === 1);
		console.log(countBs("") === 0);

		console.log(countChar("kayak", "k") === 2);
		console.log(countChar("kayak", "K") === 0);
		console.log(countChar("eaee", "e") === 3);
		console.log(countChar("", "a") === 0);

		//Additional test
		console.log(countBs2("BBBB"));
